## üí° Ideas for Contribution
PoliGuard aims to be more than just a simple tower defense game, but a complete and realistic experience. Here are some ideas for those who want to contribute:

-   **Optimization:** Optimize the game's performance, as it can lag easily.
-   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Add keyboard shortcuts to create turrets or activate skills.
-   **Structure:** Organize the folder and file structure.
-   **UI/UX Improvements:** Enhance the game's interface and overall user experience.
-   **Bug Fixes:** Help identify and fix existing bugs.
-   **Documentation:** Improve the project's documentation.
-   **Full English Translation:** Translate the entire game into English, as some parts are still in Portuguese.
-   **New Towers:** Create new types of towers with unique abilities, like a lightning tower that deals splash damage to nearby enemies.
-   **Tower Evolution Tree:** Design a system where each tower can evolve into different advanced towers.
-   **Tower Fusion:** Implement a mechanic where two or more towers can be fused together to create a more powerful one.
-   **Powered Towers:** Introduce towers that require resources to be supplied via tracks from mining centers.
-   **New Enemies:** Design new enemies with different characteristics, such as ones that split into two weaker and faster enemies upon death, enemies that regenerate health, or flying enemies that don't follow the main path.
-   **Destructive Enemies:** Create enemies that can destroy towers or have objectives other than just reaching the end of the path.
-   **Dynamic Maps:** Implement dynamic maps where the player can open doors and new paths during the game. There could also be enemies that build paths to confuse the player.
-   **Interactive Paths:** Allow the player to build new paths for enemies and close off others.
-   **Player Abilities:** Add special player abilities with a mana system, such as a "Gold Rush" to temporarily double coins earned or a targeted meteor strike.
-   **Working Countdown:** Make the wave countdown functional and display it prominently in the middle of the screen.
-   **Price Fluctuation:** Implement a system where tower prices fluctuate based on the game's state.
- **Map Zoom:** Add a map zoom system to allow for potentially infinite terrain.
- **Living Towers:** Introduce towers that gain insane upgrades if they survive for a long time.
- **Powered Towers:** Implement towers that require resources to be supplied via tracks from mining centers.
- **Destructive Enemies:** There could also be enemies that destroy these tracks and hinder the player.
-   **Synergistic Towers:** Design towers that work together and gain bonuses when placed in a specific geometric arrangement.
